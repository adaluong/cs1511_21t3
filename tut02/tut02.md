concepts to note for `buzzfeed_quiz.c`, adapted from [COMP1511 Week 02 Tutorial Questions](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T3/tut/02/questions)

## **VARIABLES**
- What are the **types of variables** that we've seen so far and what do they represent? (there are three)
- What is the difference between a **variable** and a **constant**?
- What is the difference between **declaring variable** and using **#define**?

**Setting up "types of pasta" variables**
- How can we keep track of "points"? what type of variable do we want here?
- How do we assign a value to the variable or "initialise" it?

## **INPUT/OUTPUT**
- `scanf()` and `printf()` are similar functions.
- `printf()`: print to the terminal
- `scanf()`: scan in from the terminal

**Using scanf and printf**
- How do we print to the terminal?
- How do we scan a number from the terminal?

## **PROGRAM FLOW**
- What is the syntax of C if statements? What is the role of if statements in programs?
    - Using `==` vs `=`
    - Comparison operators `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`
    - Logical operators `&&` (AND), `||` (OR)
- When do if statements run? 
    - Else if vs another if

**Creating some if statement conditions**
- using different operators from comparisons
- TYPE IN CHAT :)

**Adding points based on movie choice**
- Define the movie names as constants 1, 2, 3
- How could we modify it if the user wanted to enter a, b, c?
- How can we make use of the return value of scanf to check for errors?
